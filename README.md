# K-NN_Spaceship_Titanic_Predictions
One of university machine learning projects where we predict the possibility of a passenger surviving.

We have a dataset from a spaceship called Titanic which unfortunately crashed as it's predecessor. 
Our goal is to make a model which could predict if a passenger is likely to survive based on the
data provided. We used the K-NN algorithm for this assignment. You can find the full specification
of the project in the "ML D1 2023.pdf" file. This algorigthm refers to the 3rd exercise only (3a,3b,3c).
To run this you can open the "k_NN.ipynb" in google colab, don't forget to upload in "spaceship-titanic.csv"
in the files folder in google colab as well. The project is briefly explained in the file itself, and there
are visualizations of the data as well.
